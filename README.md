# Wakaranai Configs

This repository serves as a collection of script configurations for use within the [Wakaranai](https://github.com/Sayuri128/wakaranai) manga reader app.

# Structure
The script configuration consists of two main components:

`config.json`: This file contains metadata for the script, including a unique identifier, script name, logo URL, script type (MANGA or ANIME), NSFW indicator, language, version, protector configuration, and search availability.

`main.capyscript`: The main script file implements essential functions for fetching and processing manga or anime content.

# Planned Developments
The repository is actively maintained, and there are plans for future developments:

**Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each script configuration will be added to provide users with a clear understanding of the available sources.

**External Repositories**: An upcoming feature in Wakaranai will allow users to add external repositories directly within the app. Stay tuned for updates!
